In this lesson we will learn how to make a project.


main.py is where we control the code (the conductor)
myCode.py is where we write the functions (instruments)



1) make a function in myCode.py 


#(copy this)
def testIt():
	x = "it works"
	print(x)



2) to use the function you must import it into main.py
go to main.py.

#copy this code (it must be at the top.)
from myCode import *

testIt()

3) run the test to see if the code is working (tick mark on left)

4) if you break the code, copy the code from backup.py into myCode.py to start again. 

This will be the same for each lesson. 

5) use tab to indent. Do not use spaces. Check your spelling. These two things are the most common errors.
